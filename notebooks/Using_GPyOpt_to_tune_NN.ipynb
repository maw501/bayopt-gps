    "## Parameters to optimize\n",
    "\n",
    "With GPyOpt we can basically optimize most types of parameters, including discrete and categorical. This allows great flexibility when fitting a NN though I can't find any strong references backing this up (particularly the categorical) and so I'm unsure how well it will work in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For MNIST, given it's a small and easy data-set and I'm using a GPU we will go for quite a large domain. A simpler case would be to fix the model architecture (e.g. use a pre-trained model) and just let GPyOpt tune the hyperparameters. It's worth noting that if we did grid search on 7 parameters (as we are below) and each of those parameters could take on just 4 values we'd have $4^7$ possible values to try. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to let the BO actually vary the model's capacity via `num_lay`, `num_c` and `num_fc` which control the number of layers in the CNN, the number of channels (doubled at each layer by default) and the size of the fully connected layer at the end.\n",

    "\n",
    "It would be misleading people to present the above as though it worked first time out the box. Many times training diverged on me almost as much as it converged. This was predominantly because I had a desire to leave the domains for most parameter settings reasonably wide so as not to constrain the search too much by embedding lots of prior knowledge (after all, MNIST is a pretty overfit dataset and many scripts are online showing over 99% accuracy). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly a tension that existed in creating this example...Bayesian frameworks allow the expression of prior knowledge but by guiding things too much on MNIST I'm going to overestimate the usefulness of BO for a new data-set I know less about. \n",
    "\n",
    "If training on bigger datasets is several hours then wasted trials or divergence is a big issue*. \n",
    "\n",
    "So where does this leave us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we haven't talked about tuning the BO (via the GP kernel or exploration/exploitation trade-off) at all yet and it's here we get to a central criticism of BO, to quote [A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization of Expensive Cost Functions, with Application to Active User Modeling and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2599):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"_A particular issue is that the design of the prior is absolutely critical to efficient Bayesian optimization. Gaussian processes are not always the best or easiest solution, but even when they are, great care must be taken in the design of the kernel. In many cases, though, little is known about the objective function, and, of course, it is expensive to sample from (or we wouldn’t need to use Bayesian optimization in the first place). The practical result is that in the absence of (expensive) data, either strong assumptions are made without certainty that they hold, or a weak prior must be used. It is also often unclear how to handle the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the acquisition function. Too much exploration, and many iterations can go by without improvement. Too much exploitation leads to local maximization._\n",
    "\n",
    "_These problems are exacerbated as dimensionality is increased—more dimensions means more samples are required to cover the space, and more parameters and hyperparameters may need to be tuned, as well. In order to deal with this problem effectively, it may be necessary to do automatic feature selection, or assume independence and optimize each dimension individually._\"\n",
    "\n",
